A [full list of solver parameters](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/parameters.html) can be founds on the Gurobi website. For now we recommend setting the NumericFocus and nonConvex parameters to values of 2. Experience with the problem has also shown that a reduced MIPGap value can aid in solution time without negatively impacting the quality of the resulting solution. Gurobi's default MIPGap setting is $1e-4$. For more complex problems, a large amount of time can be spent by the solver in reducing the MIPGap below 0.1% but producing a very similar solution."
